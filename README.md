This script clean all files infected trough Ultimate Member Wordpress plugin Malware from August 2018

If you have been reached by the malware working trough a fail in Ultimate Member Plugin in middle end August 2018, first read the article that explains how works the redirect campaign here : https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/08/massive-wordpress-redirect-campaign-targets-vulnerable-tagdiv-themes-and-ultimate-member-plugins.html

Then delete manually all you have under wp-content/uploads/ultimatemember/temp/  directory of Ultimate member plugin.

Only after that, put the cleaning file everywhere on your server and run it. It will clean all injections.

As you will see, it's based on injection i've got on my server, so it could be a little bit different. That's why i added to the end a search of potential other infected files based on the search on similar terms used by the malware.

It just use the same way of the malware, but do the opposite. I try on my server (many wordpress and ohter sites infected) and in 10 seconds only it's now safe and clean.

It's not a beautif code, but it works.
